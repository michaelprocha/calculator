# caluclator

This website is a web-based calculator designed to handle the four basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — in a clear and intuitive way.
Beyond simple calculations, it allows users to combine multiple operations in a single expression and keeps a history of all performed calculations, making it easy to review previous results and understand the calculation flow.
